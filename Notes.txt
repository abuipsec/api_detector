api_detector.py Explanation:

The APIDetector class has an __init__ method to initialize the object with an empty list (detected_apis).
The detect_api method takes traffic_data as input, which could be information extracted from network traffic. This method currently uses a placeholder condition to detect APIs containing the keyword "api" in a case-insensitive manner.
The get_detected_apis method retrieves the list of detected APIs.
Please note that this is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you would replace the placeholder conditions with more sophisticated logic based on your actual requirements for API detection.

Remember to develop and test other components of your tool, such as network traffic analysis, URL pattern detection, and HTTP method detection, as they are interconnected and contribute to the overall functionality of your API detection tool.

**********************
network_traffic_analysis.py explination

This example provides two functions:

capture_traffic: Captures network traffic using Scapy. You can specify the network interface and the number of packets to capture.

analyze_http_packets: Analyzes the captured network packets to filter out HTTP packets (on port 80). Adjust the filtering criteria based on your specific requirements.

Please note that the example is minimal and may need adjustments depending on your use case. Additionally, it is essential to handle exceptions, error checking, and further analysis based on the specific goals of your API detection tool.

****************************************************

# api_detector/url_patterns.py

The identify_api_url_patterns function takes a URL as input and checks if it contains common API-related keywords.
The function returns True if any of the keywords are found in the URL, indicating that it might be an API-related URL. Otherwise, it returns False.
The example usage section demonstrates how to use the function with a sample URL (https://example.com/api/v1/data).
Keep in mind that this code provides a basic mechanism for identifying API-related URL patterns, and you may need to customize it based on your specific needs. Consider adding more sophisticated logic, handling edge cases, and incorporating additional patterns as required by your API detection tool.

*************************************************

http_methods.py

This module provides a function detect_http_methods that takes an HTTP request string as input and attempts to identify the HTTP method used in the request. It uses a list of common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and performs case-insensitive matching.

The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how you might use this module to detect the HTTP method in a sample request. Note that this is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you might need to handle more complex cases and variations in HTTP requests.

Feel free to modify this code based on your specific requirements and integrate it into your overall API detection tool.

user_interface.py

In this example:

The UserInterface class contains two static methods:

get_user_input: Prompts the user to enter a URL and returns the cleaned input.
display_result: Displays a result message to the user.
The __main__ block at the end provides a simple example of how the UserInterface class can be used. If you run user_interface.py directly, it will prompt you to enter a URL and then display a message with the entered URL.

This code assumes a simple command-line interface. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to enhance the user interface, for example, by adding input validation or providing more detailed instructions to the user.

Remember to integrate this module into your overall project structure and connect it with other modules as needed.

**************************

logging_utils.py

This example includes:

The APILogger class, which has methods for setting up the logger, logging detected API communication, and retrieving the path to the log file.
The setup_logger method configures the logger with a file handler, sets the log level to INFO, and specifies a log format.
The log_detected_api method logs detected API communication to the specified log file.
The get_log_file_path method returns the path to the log file.
This is a basic example, and you can customize it based on your specific requirements. Remember to add error handling, adjust log levels, and enhance the functionality according to your project needs.

************************
/tests/test_api_detector.py
This test file includes three test cases:

test_detect_api_with_match: Tests whether the detect_api method prints "API Detected!" when there is a match in the traffic data.
test_detect_api_without_match: Tests whether the detect_api method prints "No API detected" when there is no match in the traffic data.
test_get_detected_apis: Tests whether the get_detected_apis method returns the correct list of detected APIs.
In each test case, the unittest.mock.patch is used to replace the print function temporarily, allowing us to capture and assert on the printed output. Note that the __main__ block allows the test file to be executed directly using python -m unittest tests.test_api_detector.
