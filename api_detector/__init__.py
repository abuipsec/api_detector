# api_detector/__init__.py

# This file can remain empty or include package-level initialization code.
# It's often used to turn a directory into a Python package.
# If your package requires initialization, you can include code here.

# For example, if you want to import specific modules when the package is imported,
# you can add those imports here:

# from . import api_detector
# from . import network_traffic_analysis
# from . import url_patterns
# from . import http_methods
# from . import user_interface
# from . import logging_utils
